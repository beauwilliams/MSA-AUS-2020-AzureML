# Azure ML Demo Agenda

## What will be covered

- [ ] Introduction to AzureML - What it is, what it isn't, why it is useful
- [ ] Introductions to the resources for this course, our github, MSLearn Modules
- [ ] Setting up cloud based resources and workspaces in AzureML (New Version - Not classic)
- [ ] Setting up your cloud based compute environment (with SSH Access)
- [ ] Setting up a compute cluster (Seperate compute for 'number crunching')
- [ ] BUGFIX Updating scikit learn from the CLI (small workaround to deal with bug.. will explain)
- [ ] Cloning the MNIST dataset and AzureML Tutorials into your workspace (Sort of like cloning the git repo but within Azure)
- [ ] Using Logistic Regression to train a model using the imprted jupyter notebook
- [ ] See the results of this trained model (Note, we are creating a model to read handwritten digits)
- [ ] Deploy the model to ACI (An active containerised instance of your model, that you can test data on)
